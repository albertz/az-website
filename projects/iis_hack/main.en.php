<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
I do not take over adhesion for any damage of this program.<br>
It was programmed only from test purposes.

<p>
<b>Description</b><br>
This program "demonstrates" the possibilities of the WebClient-class
of the AZFramework (it's my pseudo name for my collection of code).<br>
It's was made to easily test an URL and get the result.<br>
As an addon, there is a builtin easy TFTP-server.
