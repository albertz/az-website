<b>History</b><br>
This game was developed as an advertisement game for the lawn-mower company SABO. But it never sold, thus I am publishing and opening it here now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Description</b><br>
SABO sells lawn-mowers and this is a lawn-mower racing game. :)

<p>
<b>Source code details</b><br>
The script language <a href="../azskript/">AZSkript (version 1)</a> is the base for this game, coupled with an abstract 2D engine based on DirectDraw.
